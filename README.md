# Guided Practice - Text Analysis

For this guided practice, you will be analyzing the contents of a book. The prompts are quantitative questions about the book's text. Write code in `analyze.js` to find the answers to these questions!

`book-text.js` contains an array of strings, where each string represents a word of H.G. Wells' _The War of the Worlds_. We will refer to these strings as **tokens**. They have been (mostly) stripped of punctuation.

Use higher order functions when applicable! Many of the prompts can be solved by using the appropriate array method.

The `solution` branch contains a possible solution to this guided practice.

## Prompts

1. How many tokens are in `bookText`?
2. What is the total number of characters in `bookText`?
3. What is the mean length of a token?
4. What is the length of the longest token?
5. How many tokens are longer than 4 characters?
6. How many tokens start with the letter "s" (case-insensitive)?
7. Do more tokens start with the letter "s" or "t"?
8. What are the 5 most frequent tokens that appear in the text, and how many times do they each appear?
9. What are the 5 most frequent characters that appear in the text, and how many times do they each appear?
10. How many tokens do not contain any vowels?

## Extensions

These prompts are entirely optional but make for great practice!

1. What is the most frequent vowel in the text?
2. If a token were to be randomly picked, what is the probability that token contains a vowel?
3. What is the mean and standard deviation of the number of vowels in each token?
4. This will require getting external data. What percentage of the tokens are verbs?
